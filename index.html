						<h3>Why Nicosia?</h3>
						<h2>Nicosia, the last divided capital in Europe</h2>
						<p>
							Nicosia, the vibrant capital of Cyprus, is a city of fascinating
							contrasts where ancient history meets modern living. As the last
							divided capital in Europe, it offers a unique blend of cultures,
							with its southern Greek Cypriot and northern Turkish Cypriot
							districts separated by the "Green Line." Visitors can explore the
							charming Old Town, surrounded by Venetian walls, where cobblestone
							streets lead to bustling markets, historic churches, and
							Ottoman-era mosques. Not to be missed is the Leventis Municipal
							Museum, which showcases the city’s rich history, and the Ledra
							Street Observatory, offering panoramic views of the city and its
							divided landscape.
						</p>
						<p>
							For those seeking a more contemporary experience, Nicosia boasts a
							thriving café culture, vibrant nightlife, and a burgeoning arts
							scene. The Cyprus Museum, housing an incredible collection of
							ancient artifacts, is a must-visit for history enthusiasts.
							Gourmands can savor local delicacies like halloumi, souvlaki, and
							loukoumades at traditional tavernas, while shoppers can explore
							high-end boutiques and quaint artisan shops. With its mix of
							old-world charm and cosmopolitan flair, Nicosia promises travelers
							a truly unforgettable experience.

								<h4>Giagia Victoria</h4>
								<p>
									Right next to the Ledras barricade and crossing point to the
									‘Turkish side of the city’, there’s a little cafe bringing
									some of the most traditional flavours of Greece to Cyprus,
									Giagia (Grandma) Victoria. Its beautiful yard is literally
									right next to the barrels and barbed wire. Fascinating and
									deeply sad if you are Cypriot or know about Cypriot history.
								</p>
								<h5>Address</h5>
								<p>Prodromou 131 G, Nicosia 2064 Cyprus</p>
								<h5>What I like about it:</h5>
								<p>
									This cafe has a lovely view, great for sitting and watching
									the passers-by. Fans and shade covers on summer days, and
									heater units on cold days. Coffee and pastries are good, and
									the price is right.

								<h4>Pieto</h4>
								<p>
									Situated in the heart of the historic Old Town of Nicosia,
									this charming café offers a delightful escape for both locals
									and travelers alike. The moment you step inside, you can’t
									help but feel as though you’ve been transported to a quaint
									café in Berlin, filled with character and charm.
								</p>
								<h5>Address</h5>
								<p>Ledras 207, Nicosia 1011, Cyprus</p>
								<h5>What I like about it:</h5>
								<p>
									This delightful cafe offers an inviting atmosphere adorned
									with unique retro decor, making it a cozy haven on Ledra St.
									Don't miss out on the charming ambiance, melodic music, and
									even friendly cats that enhance your visit!

								<h4>Caffé Nero Eleftheria Square</h4>
								<p>
									With the completion of Eleftheria Square ushering in a new era
									of revitalisation, Caffé Nero is a welcome chain and will
									surely be successful. This new café is set in a peaceful and
									comfortable environment, ideal for relaxation.Initial feedback
									since the opening has been overwhelmingly positive, with a
									significant increase in visitor numbers.

								<h5>Address</h5>
								<p>
									Eleftheria Square, Konstantinou Palaiologou, Nicosia 1010,
									Cyprus
								</p>
								<h5>What I like about it:</h5>
								<p>
									I've always loved walking into a Caffé Nero, with its
									old-world vibe, leather chairs, nooks to tuck away into, and
									warm atmosphere. I also enjoy the choice of music, usually.
